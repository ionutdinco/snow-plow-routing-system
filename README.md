# snow-plow-routing-system
A platform for managing employees and routing snow removal vehicles in Romania. The project aims to help the local public authorities in Romania by optimizing the snow removal process at the county level. The main functions of the application are to assign administrators to different counties so that they can manage the employee and vehicle registration process, to link employees with a specific program and vehicle, and to monitor the snow removal process given by a routing system composed of a set of algorithms (Grapsh, ML).
